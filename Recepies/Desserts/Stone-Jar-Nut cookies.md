# Nut Cookies Preparation

### Ingredients

125g butter, softened
100g light brown soft sugar
125g caster sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract
225g self-raising flour
½ tsp salt
200g chocolate chips

### Method

1)Preheat the oven to 180°C, gas mark 4

2)Cream butter and sugars, once creamed, combine in the egg and vanilla.

3)Sift in the flour and salt, then the chocolate chips.

4)Roll into walnut size balls, for a more homemade look, osize balls, for a more homemade look, or roll into a long, thick sausage shape and slice to make neater looking cookies.
5)Place on ungreased baking paper. If you want to have the real Millies experience then bake for just 7 minutes, till the cookies are just setting - the cookies will be really doughy and delicious. Otherwise cook for 10 minutes until just golden round the edges.
6)Take out of the oven and leave to harden for a minute before transferring to a wire cooling rack. These are great warm, and they also store well, if they don't all get eaten straight away!
